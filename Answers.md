- [ ] Mention two parts of Express that you learned about this week.

Express is just a node.js module that allows us to build RESTful webservice that works well with json. It is simple and works well with connect middlware as well which allows us to use connect modules.

- [ ] Describe Middleware?

Middleware is a function that receives the resquest and response object. It can return the response call or pass it on to the next middleware. It has the ability to manipulate request or response objects but does not need to.

- [ ] Describe a Resource?

Everything is a resource. In terms of this week, our resource is basically the data we need to have access to through our endpoints.

- [ ] What can the API return to help clients know if a request was successful?

- [ ] How can we partition our application into sub-applications?
